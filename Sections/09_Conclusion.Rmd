This study offers several novel contributions. 
It provides estimates of forcing requirements for both receptivity and pollen shed, quantifies countergradient variation and within-population variation in flowering, and predicts significant advancements in flowering under climate change for *Pinus contorta* ssp. *latifolia* (lodgepole pine). 
Estimates are based on a thermal time model fit using my assembly of the most comprehensive data set of lodgepole pine flowering available to date, spanning 259 provenances grown at 7 sites and observed over 15 years.
Unlike many phenology models that rely on day of year, which limits their applicability, the model developed here can be used across different locations and years. 
This adaptability could enable research into pollen-mediated gene flow: flowering predictions across large areas could be checked for overlap and combined with wind models to determine population connectivity.
Additionally, given the critical role of flowering in both fecundity and gene flow, these predictions may prove valuable for investigating eco-evolutionary dynamics, particularly in understanding how flowering phenology influences lodgepole pine range limits [@Chuine2001b]. 
Phenology model results could also be incorporated into larger process-based models to explore fitness consequences of plasticity and past and future adaptation [@gauzere2020; @Duputie2015].

This research found large within-population variation in flowering and modest countergradient variation associated with provenance mean annual temperature. Temperature-controlled flowering does restrict gene flow to populations from more similar climates, but both the within-population and countergradient variation act to increase gene flow among populations from more different climates. 
Phenology, however, is not the only factor controlling gene flow; studies that consider wind dispersal of pollen are necessary to understand the impacts of pollen mediated gene flow in lodgepole pine and how it will affect adaptation under climate change [@kremer2012]. The direction of pollen dispersal influences evolution along the gradient [@Soularue2014], but modelling pollen dispersal over large distances is a difficult problem. It could be simplified by using pollination phenology to rule out gene flow between populations with unmatched flowering phenology. 

Advances in flowering phenology of several weeks are anticipated for lodgepole pine under climate change. While the limited analyses here suggest it will not have a large impact on gene flow, further investigation is warranted using more sites or even considering the full range. Other climate change impacts could be incorporated as well. Importantly, gene flow could be impacted by range shifts likely under climate change [@mackenzie2021], other climate change related disruptions like increased fire and bark beetle outbreaks [@Sambaraju2012; @parisien2023], or the impact of extensive logging. Gene flow may simply be lost from many populations because they are gone, temporarily or permanently.

Data collected in seed orchards is incredibly valuable for research and enabled this study. However, its use is limited by non-standard collection and recording and its fragmentation across many sites. The flowering phenology data set here is very valuable, but required a large effort to obtain, standardize, and clean the data before it could be used. Both government and private resources were used to collect this data. Consolidating, standardizing and publishing other data collected in seed orchards would provide greater return on that investment.

This model used MAT as a proxy for provenance. However, MAT may not be the best variable to represent provenance variation. MAT's performance as a proxy variable could be tested by ground truthing phenology at site pairs like Border and Trench, which have very different MATs due to winter differences but very similar spring warmups. When provenances with very different MATs have very similar spring warmups, their forcing requirements will be different according to the model here. This means divergence in flowering time and reduced gene flow potential between populations that are relatively similar in climate. Climate variables other than MAT could be more appropriate and better represent provenance variation and should be investigated.

One of the advantages of the thermal time model presented here is its relative simplicity. However, it does have some potential limitations, especially if it is used for more southerly portions of the range or for climate change projections. The model should be verified or updated with data from more southern provenances before extending it across the range. This model was built using observational data, but experiments may provide better forcing estimates, clarify whether and how to include photoperiod and chilling effects, and quantify forcing thresholds [@hanninen2019; @Chuine2001]. End event estimation may improve if start and end events are included in a multi-stage model. 

This study’s flowering phenology model and dataset for lodgepole pine offer a foundation for future research into climate-driven phenological shifts, gene flow, and adaptation. Building on this work could reveal new insights into how phenology influences ecological and evolutionary dynamics under climate change across lodgepole pine’s range.
