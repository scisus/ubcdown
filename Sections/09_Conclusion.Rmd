This study offers several novel contributions. 
It presents a model of both receptivity and pollen shed, quantifies countergradient variation and within-population variation in flowering, and predicts significant advancements in flowering under climate change for *Pinus contorta* ssp. *latifolia*. 
The model is based on the most comprehensive data set of lodgepole pine flowering assembled to date, spanning 259 provenances grown at 7 sites and observed over 15 years.
Unlike many phenology models that rely on day of year, which limits their applicability, the model developed here can be used across different locations and years. 
This adaptability could enable research into pollen-mediated gene flow; flowering predictions across large areas could be checked for overlap and combined with wind models to determine population connectivity.
Additionally, given the critical role of flowering in both fecundity and gene flow, these predictions may prove valuable for investigating eco-evolutionary dynamics, particularly in understanding how flowering phenology influences lodgepole pine range limits [@Chuine2001b]. 
Phenology model results could also be incorporated into larger process-based models to explore fitness consequences of plasticity and past and future adaptation [@gauzere2020, @Duputie2015].
