The timing of flowering influences adaptation and where species occur because it affects plants' ability to reproduce and which other plants they reproduce with. 
Lodgepole pine is an important species in British Columbia's forests and forestry industry.
After compiling a large data set, I modelled how much warmth lodgepole pine needs to "flower" (shed and receive pollen) in the spring. 
I found northern populations require less warmth to flower than southern populations, so lodgepole populations tend to reproduce with others in similar climates, which supports local adaptation. 
However, individual trees vary more than populations, balancing local adaptation with genetic diversity within populations. 
With climate change, lodgepole are expected to flower several weeks earlier by 2100 than they do today without strongly altering which populations can reproduce with each other.
The predictive model developed here will enable more research into how flowering timing affects lodgepole ecology and evolution.
